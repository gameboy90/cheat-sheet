1.first trick is yank all line at any position of the target line =>
    yy [i just can't get how it works,try it];also ,you can try y$,but this require the curser position at the start of the line.
2.yank the whole file =>
    you can press gg to locate your curser to the start of the file,then press yG to copy all the content from the start to end(G located) to buffer.
